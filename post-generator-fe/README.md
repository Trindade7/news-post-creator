# Post generator Frontend

Used create the Frontend for the News Post Generator. The app allows you to select the news from different sources, create and print the posts. It is built using **Svelt**, and **Tailwindcss**.

The frontend consists of 3 main Pages:

1. A **Headline picker** where, you pick the headlines you'd like to use
2. A **Post creator** where, you can assign headlines to specific posts from different sources, including saved headlines or auto populate cards
3. A **Preview page**, to preview the finished posts posts

The pages are compiled exported to the server so **to run the project use the** [server folder](https://github.com/Trindade7/news-post-creator/api-server).
