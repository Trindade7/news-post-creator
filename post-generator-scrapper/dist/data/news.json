Unlike regular NFTs, KIWIE NFT collectors will gain exclusive ownership over real-life street artwork anywhere in the world through blockchain technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first batch of exclusive NFTs will be launched via Rarible on April 13th. Following this launch, KIWIE plans to release four more collections in the coming months, all of which will be new NFT-specific artworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBlockchain \u0026amp; NFTs To Redefine ‘Ownership’\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach KIWIE NFT will be for individual artworks. For each piece of art, a 3D model will be generated, representing the actual street art. The figure will include a geotag linking the NFT to its respective artwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holder of the NFT effectively owns the street art and is free to resell the artwork. Once the KIWIE NFT is purchased, a metal certificate will be printed and sent to the owner of the NFT. This metal certificate will act as a \u003ci\u003erare collectible\u003c/i\u003e and will only be made once per artwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFormer Managing Director of Riot Games Europe, Paul Breslin, highlights that this innovative idea can redefine street-art ownership and enable more artists to monetize their content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe underlines:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I have been following Kiwie for years and am continuously being blown away by the creativity and originality. This project goes beyond just NFT\u0026#8217;s and in the world of gaming has many avenues to delight and entertain the global gaming audience for years to come.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eStreet Art, Blockchain, NFT \u0026#8211; A New World Of Content\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKIWIE’s lead business strategist and blockchain gaming industry veteran,  Kristaps Vaivods, is the person behind this unique idea of fusing NFT and street art using blockchain technology. He is highly confident that this concept will be a game-changer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe states:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The Fat Monster is a unique and iconic creation, and it’s different from what many other street artists do. I just love the global community that formed around the cute monsters, and I hope that the ability to really own a piece of street art will be even more inspirational.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNFTs revolutionize the street art landscape due to their non-invasive aspect. Previously, selling a graffiti artist\u0026#8217;s work meant detaching the wall where it was painted, as the location was a significant part of its existence. Through KIWIE NFTs, collectors will own the digital version and the physical version of the art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKIWIE, the original creator of Fat Monster, concludes, “Using NFTs to represent ownership allows us to maintain the beauty of the art intact. Blockchain is not just a buzzword here, it legitimately enables something that used to be impossible.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post These limited edition NFTs of real-life street art are getting listed on Rarible appeared first on CryptoSlate.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
